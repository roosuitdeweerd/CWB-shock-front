# CWB Shock Front

This repository contains Python code to model the shock front of a Colliding Wind Binary (CWB) system. 
The code calculates the coordinates of the two massive stars and the shape of the shock front.
It then places the shock front in the sky, as if observed from Earth.
This model is applied to WR 140 and Apep.
Results can be compared with observational data from radio and optical interferometry.

For details on usage, see the comments in the code.
